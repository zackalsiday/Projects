Weathery is a weather history app that provides students and reaserches with a data collection tracking how the weather has progressed and changed over time. After you choose your location you will be asked to choose a month and day. You should be provided with a chart of that same day's weathor history to as far back as possible. To make it more visiual, users will be provided with a line graph for the increase and decrease of weather measurments wether it's celsius/farenhiet degree, rain percentage, humidty and more!.

In Weathery, users will be able to: 

    - Locate what city they'd like to see the Weathery history.
    - Filter out what weather precisely they'd like to see (ex.celsius,farenhiet,etc)
    - See a visual line graph to get a better understanding of their research.

In addition, this project will include:

    - an About model explaining what api's where used and what type of information can we find through them. 
    - A README that gives and overall summary of everything needed to know about this project.
